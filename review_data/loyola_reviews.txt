"content": "I brought my wife and two children (10, 14) and our dog Oakley to this lakefront property August 7-13th and it was our first time in this area. First, the cottage had everything we needed. There was plenty of space for the 4 of us, with a comfortable master room and then a side room with bunk beds. The living room was comfortable and adjoining kitchen was well stocked with cooking supplies. There is even a dishwasher. We spent our days hiking (Raven trail) or exploring downtown Minocqua or Woodruff. Mini Golfing and Go-Carts. My wife would also go to the casino several times, which is only 6 minutes away. We thought the location was perfect. You are down a little private drive, but are 15-20 minutes from town, groceries, food, etc. We ate out about twice a day (and were so looking forward to that)...and tried many of local establishments. There is a nice sized TV that has access to HULU, Disney, Netflix, etc if you have accounts (and we did). Internet was great. We spent time on the water of course and I had brought my 17ft Lund to do fishing and tubing. The launch is very nice on Fence Lake and is across the lake. The cottage's dock arrangement (shaped like an L) did make some of this challenging and I had to be creative every time I used my boat to get it to fit on the end of the dock because of the pontoon that is there and that the water is very shallow at the sides of the dock. In the end, we made it work, but I recommend checking with the owner if you have a boat of any size first. Overall, we loved our stay and owner was very responsive (like when we could not find tennis rackets). Made wonderful memories.",

We didn't need to take the things noted in our reservation list as most all of it was supplied. Didn't know that we would have great Internet service and streaming TV. The Fence Lake chain was the highlight for us. Enjoyed nature and wildlife. . . . eagles and loons. Loved that we could keep the boat on the dock and launch it nearby. Other highlights included the beautiful sunsets. Sunsets and wine went very well together. :)",

We even enjoyed some games during the rain. The water's clear and shallow off the dock for younger kids. My girls enjoyed catching crawfish. MY older boys also caught some nice size bass right off the dock. Location is great. Neil was great to work with and very responsive when it came to questions. We'd definitely go back.",
